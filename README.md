#Akoa data classification
##1 data decompression and classification
First, decompress the downloaded dataset with the following code, and store the left and right knees in different directories respectively:
```sh
python unzip.py your_ path
` ` ` `
Where, ` your_ Path 'refers to the file path of your dataset (ZIP format, do not unzip).

##2 model training and testing
In[ test.ipynb ] test.ipynb ）It shows the programming and visualization of the code. [Record_ training_ log.ipynb ](Record_ training_ log.ipynb ）The training log was recorded.

##3 visualization

##The precision and loss of 4 test set
The accuracy and loss of the model in the test set are 0.9990363121032715 and 0.003378412453457713 respectively.
